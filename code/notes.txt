workflow
    training
    validation on holdout set generated from training dataset
    evaluation on the test dataset

fit() = training model by slicing data into batch_size and repeatedly iterating over entire dataset for given number of epochs
history = holds record of loss values and metric values during training (loss, sparse_categorial_accuracy, validation_loss, validation_sparse_categorial_accuracy)
evaluate() = evaluate model on test data (returns loss, sca)
compile() = needed to train a model w fit(), specifies loss function, optimizer and metrics to observe
