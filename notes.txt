system model tutorial:https://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=InvertedPendulum&section=SystemModeling

theta = angle 
thetadot = angular velocity 
thetaddot = angular acceleration
x = cart position
xdot = cart velocity
xddot = cart acceleration

Input to the AI model = return value from the controller (which uses 4 const variables and 4 state variables)
Output from the AI model = 4 variables (theta, x, thetadot, xdot)

test cases:
    1. model starts normal, balances itself over time 
        1. pendulum swung down, then came back up then balanced
        2. pendulum stayed upright
        3. pendulum stayed upright
    2. model starts normal, gets nudged a few times but stays upright
        1. nudged at relatively normal intervals, pendulum stayed upright
        2. nudged randomly, pendulum stayed upright
    3. model starts normal, gets nudged a few times and turns into regular pendulum 
        1. nudged a few times, fell down but came back up
        2. nudged a few times, fell down but came back up, stayed down for a longer period of time
    4. model starts as regular pendulum, no nudges
        1. started with the pendulum close to being horizontal, stayed down
        2. started with pendulum close to vertical
    5. model starts as regular pendulum, nudged a few times
        1. started with pendulum close to being horizontal, nudged a few times, stayed down
        2. started with pendulum close to being vertical, nudged few times, stayed down
    6. nudging pendulum constantly to get model used to it

test cases 2:
    1. pendulum starts upright, untouched (get from previous set)
        1. pendulum swung down, didn't come back up
        2. pendulum stayed upright
        3. pendulum stayed upright
    2. pendulum starts upright, gets nudged but stays upright
        1. nudged at 5s
        2. nudged at 2, 4, 6, 8s 
        3. nudged every 1s
        4. nudged randomly (see onenote)
    3. pendulum starts upright, gets nudged AND falls down, could either be due to nudge or independent
        1. nudged at 5s (comes back up)
        2. nudged at 2, 4, 6, 8s (comes back up)
        3. nudged every 1s (comes back up)
        4. nudged randomly (comes back up)
    4. pendulum starts with pendulum fallen, no nudges
        1. started with pendulum close to horizontal
        2. started with pendulum close to vertical
        3. started with pendulum close to horizontal again, swung around but stayed down
    5. model starts with pendulum fallen, gets nudged 
        1. nudged at 5s (stays down)
        2. nudged at 2, 4, 6, 8s (stays down)
        3. nudged every 1s (stays down)
        4. nudged randomly 

research questions should have resources that are able to answer them
write down benchmarks
control methods?
write number of times I nudged the pendulum
